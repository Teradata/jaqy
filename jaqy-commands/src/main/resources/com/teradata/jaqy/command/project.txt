usage: .project [columns]

The column syntax is similar to that of SELECT expression list, except that
the only expression supported is the column itself.  The column can be renamed
using AS clause.

Column indexes also be used, but need to have a @ prefix.

Examples:

.project a, b
.project a AS Test, b as "Column 2"
.project @1, @2 AS bbb
