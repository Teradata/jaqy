.desc
-----

``.desc`` displays the schema for a table.

Syntax
~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

	usage: usage: .desc [options] [table name]
	options:
	  -s,--sql   display schema in SQL

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example was tested done on PostgreSQL.

.. code-block:: sql

	create table mytable ( a int, b int );
	-- success. update count = 0
	-- 1/2 - 0 - postgres @ localhost - public --
	.desc mytable
	Column Type Nullable
	------ ---- --------
	a      int4 Yes
	b      int4 Yes
	-- 1/3 - 0 - postgres @ localhost - public --
	.desc -s mytable
	CREATE TABLE mytable (
	    a int4,
	    b int4
	)
	-- 1/4 - 0 - postgres @ localhost - public --

Generic Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The generic approach used by Jaqy basically uses the following SQL to generate
the column list.  And from the column list, infer the table schema.

.. code-block::	sql

	SELECT * FROM TABLENAME WHERE 1=0

Obviously, it will not contain information such as indexes, triggers,
constraints, etc.  Sometimes, the table column type may not be exact, due to
the limitations in JDBC capabilities providing the type information.  The
mapping of the JDBC type to SQL type for the current database can be found
using `.info typemap <info.html>`__ command.

**Known issues** XML type in Apache Derby cannot be directly selected out using
the approach above.  The command will fail as the result.  TBH, it is Apache
Derby's design issue.

Database Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This command can be configured using
`database configurations <../config/database.html>`__ to
use database specific SQL rather than the generic approach used.  For instance,
Teradata uses ``HELP TABLE <tableName>`` and ``SHOW TABLE <tableName>`` to get
the column information, and the table schema, respectively.

By default, MySQL, Teradata, SQLite have been configured to use the native
approach to display the table columns and schema.
